This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to realize character movements in Unity Engine, whichh is one of most basic functions in any games. In this project, a character from Unity Asset Store is used as an example, and the entire project file can be download from [Google drive][https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLikoaRcjS-FViOHQH-A6wQJaJki-yGG/view?usp=drive_link].



### Procedure

The procedure can be divided into three parts

- Animations: Create character related animations based on original resource

- Arnimator: Build Prefab of thhe character, which includes animations 

- Control Scripts: Programming scripts to control the character

  

Details follow the description below:



**Animations **

Download resource from asset store:

1. Get partial original game material in the Unity Asset Storeï¼›

2. Cut frames from original sprite images

3. Build animations

2. Set boundary conditions (contains variables)



**Control Scripts **
